Apache Ozone Operators
======================

The Ozone provider is CLI-first: operators delegate most runtime work to
``OzoneFsHook`` or ``OzoneAdminHook`` and execute native ``ozone`` commands.

Prerequisites
-------------

To use these operators, configure an :doc:`Ozone Connection <connections>`
and make sure the worker runtime has:

* Java runtime available to the worker.
* ``ozone`` CLI available in ``PATH``.
* ``ozone-site.xml`` and ``core-site.xml`` reachable through ``ozone_conf_dir``
  or otherwise available in the worker runtime.

Common operator parameters
--------------------------

Most operators accept:

* ``ozone_conn_id``: Airflow connection ID. Defaults to ``ozone_default`` for
  filesystem operations and ``ozone_admin_default`` for administrative
  operations.
* ``retry_attempts``: number of CLI retries for transient failures.
* ``timeout``: timeout in seconds for the underlying CLI command.

Administrative operators
------------------------

These operators use ``OzoneAdminHook`` and work with Ozone volumes, buckets,
and quotas.

* ``OzoneCreateVolumeOperator``: create a volume if it does not exist.
* ``OzoneCreateBucketOperator``: create a bucket inside a target volume.
* ``OzoneSetQuotaOperator``: apply a quota to a volume or bucket.
* ``OzoneDeleteVolumeOperator``: delete a volume, optionally recursively.
* ``OzoneDeleteBucketOperator``: delete a bucket, optionally recursively.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    from airflow.providers.arenadata.ozone.operators.ozone import (
        OzoneCreateBucketOperator,
        OzoneCreateVolumeOperator,
        OzoneSetQuotaOperator,
    )

    create_volume = OzoneCreateVolumeOperator(
        task_id="create_volume",
        volume_name="analytics",
        ozone_conn_id="ozone_admin_default",
    )

    create_bucket = OzoneCreateBucketOperator(
        task_id="create_bucket",
        volume_name="analytics",
        bucket_name="landing",
        ozone_conn_id="ozone_admin_default",
    )

    set_quota = OzoneSetQuotaOperator(
        task_id="set_quota",
        volume="analytics",
        bucket="landing",
        quota="20GB",
        ozone_conn_id="ozone_admin_default",
    )

Filesystem operators
--------------------

These operators use ``OzoneFsHook`` and work with ``ofs://`` or ``o3fs://``
paths.

Path and object creation:

* ``OzoneCreatePathOperator``: create a directory path in Ozone FS.
* ``OzoneUploadContentOperator``: write inline text content to a temporary file
  and upload it to Ozone.
* ``OzoneUploadFileOperator``: upload a local file to Ozone.

Path and object removal:

* ``OzoneDeleteKeyOperator``: delete one key or a wildcard-selected key set.
* ``OzoneDeletePathOperator``: delete a path, optionally recursively.

Path inspection:

* ``OzonePathExistsOperator``: return ``True`` or ``False`` via XCom depending
  on path existence.
* ``OzoneListOperator``: list keys/paths and return the result via XCom.

In-cluster file movement:

* ``OzoneMoveOperator``: move or rename a key/path inside Ozone.
* ``OzoneCopyOperator``: copy a key/path inside Ozone.
* ``OzoneDownloadFileOperator``: download a remote key to local filesystem.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    from airflow.providers.arenadata.ozone.operators.ozone import (
        OzoneCreatePathOperator,
        OzoneListOperator,
        OzoneUploadContentOperator,
    )

    create_path = OzoneCreatePathOperator(
        task_id="create_path",
        path="ofs://om-service/analytics/landing/incoming",
        ozone_conn_id="ozone_default",
    )

    upload_marker = OzoneUploadContentOperator(
        task_id="upload_marker",
        content="ready",
        remote_path="ofs://om-service/analytics/landing/incoming/_SUCCESS",
        ozone_conn_id="ozone_default",
    )

    list_files = OzoneListOperator(
        task_id="list_files",
        path="ofs://om-service/analytics/landing/incoming/*",
        ozone_conn_id="ozone_default",
    )

Size-aware upload and download
------------------------------

``OzoneUploadContentOperator``, ``OzoneUploadFileOperator``, and
``OzoneDownloadFileOperator`` support ``max_content_size_bytes``.

If this parameter is not passed explicitly, the operator uses the
connection-level limit from ``OzoneConnSnapshot.max_content_size_bytes``.
This helps protect workers from unexpectedly large payloads.

Design notes
------------

The operators intentionally stay thin:

* validation and CLI execution live in hooks and utils;
* SSL and Kerberos wiring come from the connection contract;
* operator code focuses on task arguments and Airflow integration.
