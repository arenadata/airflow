Apache Ozone Transfers
======================

The provider currently exposes two transfer-oriented building blocks:

* ``HdfsToOzoneOperator`` for bulk migration from HDFS to Ozone with
  ``hadoop distcp``;
* ``OzoneBackupOperator`` for bucket snapshot creation as a backup or
  lifecycle checkpoint step.

HdfsToOzoneOperator
-------------------

``HdfsToOzoneOperator`` migrates data from HDFS to Ozone using native
``hadoop distcp``.

Typical use cases:

* initial migration from HDFS to Ozone;
* ingestion pipelines where Ozone is the destination storage;
* bulk copy of large path trees that should stay outside Python memory.

Runtime notes:

* the worker must have ``hadoop`` in ``PATH``;
* the operator validates runtime dependencies before starting DistCp;
* HDFS SSL and Kerberos settings are read from ``hdfs_conn_id`` and applied
  only to the DistCp subprocess environment;
* if ``hdfs_conn_id`` is omitted, no HDFS-specific Airflow connection settings
  are injected and DistCp relies on the worker's local Hadoop runtime setup;
* a dedicated ``apache-airflow-providers-apache-hdfs`` package is not required
  by this operator implementation;
* Ozone destination access is resolved by the Hadoop/Ozone client runtime
  available on the worker, not by a dedicated ``ozone_conn_id`` argument in
  this operator.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    from airflow.providers.arenadata.ozone.transfers.hdfs_to_ozone import HdfsToOzoneOperator

    migrate_to_ozone = HdfsToOzoneOperator(
        task_id="migrate_to_ozone",
        source_path="hdfs:///warehouse/source_table",
        dest_path="ofs://om-service/analytics/landing/source_table",
        hdfs_conn_id="hdfs_default",
    )

OzoneBackupOperator
-------------------

``OzoneBackupOperator`` creates a bucket snapshot through native Ozone admin
CLI commands.

Typical use cases:

* create a recovery point before cleanup;
* preserve a landing bucket before archive/move operations;
* add an idempotent safety checkpoint to lifecycle DAGs.

Behavior notes:

* ``volume``, ``bucket``, and ``snapshot_name`` are templated;
* if the target snapshot already exists, the operator treats it as success;
* runtime and authentication are handled through ``ozone_admin_default`` or a
  custom admin connection.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    from airflow.providers.arenadata.ozone.transfers.ozone_backup import OzoneBackupOperator

    create_snapshot = OzoneBackupOperator(
        task_id="create_snapshot",
        volume="analytics",
        bucket="landing",
        snapshot_name="landing_{{ ts_nodash }}",
        ozone_conn_id="ozone_admin_default",
    )
