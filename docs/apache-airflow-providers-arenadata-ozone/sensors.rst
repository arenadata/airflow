Apache Ozone Sensors
====================

Prerequisites
-------------

To use sensors, configure an :doc:`Ozone Connection <connections>` and
make sure the worker runtime can execute the native ``ozone`` CLI.

OzoneKeySensor
--------------

``OzoneKeySensor`` waits for a file or directory to appear in Ozone FS.
It is useful for:

* waiting for marker files such as ``_SUCCESS``;
* waiting for upstream ingestion into a landing path;
* coordinating DAGs that exchange data through Ozone.

The sensor uses ``OzoneFsHook`` internally and checks a target ``ofs://`` or
``o3fs://`` path with the provider's standard connection-driven runtime
configuration.

Behavior notes
--------------

* ``path`` is templated, so Jinja expressions can be used in DAGs.
* ``timeout`` is the timeout in seconds for a single Ozone CLI existence check.
  The sensor stores this value internally as ``cli_timeout`` before calling
  ``OzoneFsHook.key_exists(...)``.
* ``timeout`` is intentionally not forwarded to ``BaseSensorOperator`` and does
  not control the overall waiting horizon of the sensor. Use standard Airflow
  sensor arguments, such as ``poke_interval`` and other ``BaseSensorOperator``
  options, for sensor scheduling behavior.
* retryable CLI errors are treated as "not yet ready" and do not fail the task
  immediately;
* non-retryable CLI errors are raised to Airflow as task failures.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    from airflow.providers.arenadata.ozone.sensors.ozone import OzoneKeySensor

    wait_for_marker = OzoneKeySensor(
        task_id="wait_for_marker",
        path="ofs://om-service/analytics/landing/{{ ds_nodash }}/_SUCCESS",
        ozone_conn_id="ozone_default",
        timeout=60,
        poke_interval=30,
    )
